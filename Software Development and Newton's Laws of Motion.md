*First Law* When viewed in an inertial reference frame, an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.

A team/product is either dead (therefore remains at rest) or is moving at a constant velocity (let's say generating certain amount of revenue or eating certain amount of buget per day). To change that we need some kind of external force. 

  - developers are fixing bugs 
  - developers are adding new features 
  - developers are introducing more bugs (lol)
  - business requests to cut down the operation cost 
  - third party competition is changing the market 
  - this list goes on and on 
  
*Second Law* Second law: F = ma. The vector sum of the forces F on an object is equal to the mass m of that object multiplied by the acceleration vector a of the object.

  It is funny that lots of people are talking about team velocity which is pretty much nonsense if we take *First Law* into consideration. The team/product is already running at certain velocity (well can be 0 or negative). So stop talking about velocity, what matters is acceleration, the ability to *change* the velocity. Here comes the interesting part, for a given force F, the acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass. Mass is the burdern of the team/product. Here is a short list of the mass
  
  - too many good to have features 
  - too much technical debt
  - too many abstractions, layers upon layers, ORM, DAO, service, controller, view, we need all of them to get some trivial {"user_id": 123} out of that database. oh forget to mention, there is SQL, and NoSQL ... 
  - too many processes 
  - too many communication delegations, business -&gt; project manager -&gt; business analyst -&gt; team leader -&gt; developer (add more roles at your own will)
