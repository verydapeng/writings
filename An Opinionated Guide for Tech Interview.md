# How to fail my interview



After 8 years of hardcore coding, 3 years of active interviewing, I have quite a lot to say about tech interviews.




## the tech

## the interviewee

### resume
assertTrue(pageCount <= 2)
Please, don't give me a 10 pages docx file and that is filled up with tables. Ultimately, programming and writing are the same. You dealing with loads of texts, the source codes and the docx, and trying your best to convey some ideas to another entity, the compiler and the interviewer. Therefore resume is the very first demostration of the developer's coding skill, and the compiler is me. Unless you want to deliberately advertising youself as a **verbose** programmer, be concise! One page is perfect and two pages max.

assertTrue(spellingChecked)
These days spelling checkers are everywhere, there is no execuse not to spend 5mins to run through one of them.
Don't fool yourself that only the compilers complain about wrongly spelled variable names. Humans do so in a different way. While human brain is vastly better than computer compilers to make sense of gibberish texts, there is a big down side, the error messages are hidden. If you make a mistake in your source codes, the compiler will yell at you. If you have a typo in your resume, chances are you will still see my smile, but you managed to have a negative contribution to your interview score.
